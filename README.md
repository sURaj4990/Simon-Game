Here are the steps and rules for playing Simon:

Components:
The Simon game unit consists of four colored buttons (red, blue, green, and yellow).
Each button produces a unique sound and lights up when pressed.

Objective:
The goal is to correctly repeat an ever-increasing sequence of colors and sounds that Simon generates.

Game Modes:
Simon typically has different game modes. Let’s cover the most common ones:
a. Single Player Mode:
Press any keyboard button to begin.
Simon will give the first signal (a color).
Repeat the signal by pressing the corresponding color button.
Simon will duplicate the first signal and add one more.
Continue repeating the sequence as long as you can.
After the 5th, 9th, and 13th signals, Simon automatically speeds up.
If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly or take more than 2 seconds, Simon responds with a “RAZZ” sound, indicating you’ve lost.

Try to reach the longest sequence possible (up to 31 signals) in single-player mode.
If you make it to 31 signals, Simon will salute you with six short signals.
Remember, Simon is all about concentration, memory, and quick reflexes. So, get ready to press those colorful buttons and outwit Simon! 🔵🟢🟡🔴
